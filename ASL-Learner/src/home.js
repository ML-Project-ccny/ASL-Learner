linguistic properties as spoken languages, with grammar that differs from English. By using the
hand and face, it is being expressed. ASL is mostly used for North American people who are
deaf and hard of hearing. Many other countries have their sign languages. Even though most of
the sign languages are similar, they have some differences. American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language. It has the same

                        <p className='descSumm'>&emsp; American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language that serves as the 
                    predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States of America and most of Anglophone Canada. 
                    ASL is a complete and organized visual language that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual features. 
                    Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, 
                    including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. 
                    ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). 
                    It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.
                    ASL is mostly used for North American people who are deaf and hard of hearing. Many other countries have their sign languages. 
                    Even though most of the sign languages are similar, they have some differences.
