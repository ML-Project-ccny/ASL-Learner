## Design and Experiments 

### Software Design
The program has two main components, a backend, and a frontend. In the front end, we used React to create the user interface. When necessary the frontend sends requests to the backend. The backend then handles the requests. It is connected to a database on which the backend can perform CRUD functionality. The backend then sends data back to the frontend in the form of JSON. Also within the backend, there exists a .pt file and a model.py file. The .pt file contains the weights of the model we trained. Those weights are then loaded into the model that is in the model.py file. The backend can then use ML model and start inserting inputs and returning outputs.

### ML Model Design
The ML model used for gesture classification is a modified ResNet152. The output layer of the model was modified to produce 26 classes which correspond to 26 letters in the alphabet. The model was trained for one epoch with ResNet152 layers frozen and then for an additional epoch with all layers unfrozen. 

#### Hyperparameters
```python
epochs = 1
max_lr = 1e-4
grad_clip = 0.1
weight_decay = 1e-4
opt_func = torch.optim.Adam
```

To improve the model training each image has a resize to 200x200, 25-pixel padding added to each side, a random horizontal flip, a random rotation of 10 degrees, and a random perspective.

#### Train Data Transforms
```python
train_tfms = tt.Compose([
                         tt.Resize((200, 200)),
                         tt.RandomCrop(200, padding=25, padding_mode='reflect'),
                         tt.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
                         tt.RandomRotation(10),
                         tt.RandomPerspective(distortion_scale=0.2),
                         tt.ToTensor()
                        ])                       
```
The images used for testing the model were first preprocessed using a [tool](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) to remove the background of an image. This [background removal model](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) is also used in the backend to preprocess images before the evaluation using ResNet152. That allows us to avoid the background of the gestures confusing the model which increases the accuracy of classification.

An example of image preprocessing using this tool:

<br/>
<div align="center" style="display:grid; 
            justify-content: center;
            padding:15px 0 30px 0">
    <div>
        <img style="margin-right: 35px" src = "https://imgur.com/zqFGk1u.png" />

        <img style="margin-left: 35px" src = "https://imgur.com/1cVVKhi.png" />
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

The initial model for the website was a simple convolutional neural network built from scratch. There were several different variations of the built-from-scratch model, however, the best overall was a one-dimensional image classification model trained on images 75x75, which had 4 ReLU dense layers, and 3 ReLU convolutional layers.

#### Units per Layer
```python
self.dense_layer_1 = nn.Linear(1470, 800)
self.dense_layer_2 = nn.Linear(800, 600)
self.dense_layer_3 = nn.Linear(600, 500)
self.dense_layer_4 = nn.Linear(500, 300)
self.output_layer = nn.Linear(300, 26)
```
#### Convolutional Layer Parameters
```python
kernel_size1=5, stride1=2
kernel_size2=4, stride2=1
kernel_size3=3, stride3=1
```
#### Hyperparameters
```python
epochs = 4
criterion = torch.nn.NLLLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)
```
But, that initial approach was incorrect, since image classification is much more complex, and such a simple model would not be able to produce good results. Even though a combination with background removal allowed us to achieve high testing and training accuracy for the initial model, it failed with the evaluation of other datasets that were not used for training. The best accuracy on the non-training dataset was 17%, which is more than a probability of random guessing (1/26 = 3.8%), but still not enough for good classification of gestures.

Because of the reason described above, a pre-trained image classification model was used. The first version was ResNet34. It immediately was able to produce a much higher accuracy on non-training datasets (60% to 70% depending on the dataset used for testing), unlike the built-from-scratch model. It was clear that the overfitting didn't happen anymore, and the usage of a pre-trained model was the right path. Different experiments were performed to make the accuracy even higher, but the best solution again was to use another more complex model, which is the ResNet152. A model similar to ResNet152, Regnet_y_32gf, was also tested, but the accuracy results were similar, so the decision was to stay with ResNet152. The parameters used to train pre-trained models are identical to the parameters used for the final model. Testing data was also first preprocessed using [background removal model](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg).

### ML Dataset Description
#### Synthetic
Dataset used for training the built-from-scratch model. The idea was to make our model distinguish between hand and background since the synthetic dataset contains a lot of images with simulated backgrounds. It didn't work, so the background removal model was used instead.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allexmendes/asl-alphabet-synthetic

#### Londhe
Dataset used at first to test the built-from-scratch model trained with a Synthetic dataset. Since the accuracy was 0%, this dataset was used after to train the built-from-scratch model, while synthetic was used only for testing. There was no improvement.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapillondhe/american-sign-language

#### Akash
Dataset used to train the ResNet34 and ResNet152. It was also used to test the built-from-scratch model. For some experiments, images with pairs of often misclassified gestures were replaced, but that didn't improve accuracy, so the default Akash dataset was used to get the final version of our model based on ResNet152.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

#### Rasband
The primary testing dataset was used for ResNet34, ResNet152, and Regnet_y_32gf. The decision to either continue to improve the model or to stop was primarily based on the Rasband accuracy. This dataset has a good variety of hands and backgrounds.

#### PHP 
Dataset used once to train ResNet34. It was used in the experiment to improve the accuracy of ResNet34.

#### Geislinger
Dataset used once to test built-from-scratch model. Images didn't have a fixed size, so the dataset wasn't used further anymore.

### User Interface Design
When the user opens the app, they are greeted by a home page, in which they can learn about ASL and the purposes of the application. When the user clicks on ‘next’, they are sent to the level page. They have the option to sign in/ sign up. If they do their performance is tracked and the user can analyze it by going to the user info page. When a word is clicked the game page is then loaded. The user is prompted to hold up their hand to the webcam and try to replicate the letter that is shown to them. The accuracy is also displayed. Once they finish the word, they are sent back to the level page and the performance is updated. The user can choose another word or check their performance.

- Place the Akash dataset in a folder named 'dataset_akash.' Place this folder in the same directory that contains model_training.ipynb file. Make sure that the dataset folder contains the Test and Train folders. Test and Train folders must contain 26 letter folders each.
- Open model_training.ipynb file and run. The model will be saved in the same directory that contains model_training.ipynb file.
- Download the [Rasband](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danrasband/asl-alphabet-test) dataset and place it in the folder named 'dataset_rasband.' Place this folder in the same directory that contains model_training.ipynb file. Make sure that the dataset folder contains the Test folder. This dataset can be used for the evaluation of testing accuracy.

## Challenges Faced
### ML side
The model ResNet152 used for the project is not ideal. Some gestures (particularly gestures for pairs of letters E&S, K&V, and G&H) are often misclassified because of the similarity between them. See the example for letters E and S below:

<br/>
<div align="center" style="display:grid; 
            justify-content: center;
            padding:15px 0 30px 0">
    <div>
        <img style="margin-right: 35px" src = "https://imgur.com/SjzD6Gz.png" />
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <img style="margin-left: 35px" src = "https://imgur.com/RWperuv.png" />
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

We have tried to implement two possible solutions to it. One was a multiple-frame classification, and another was to use additional binary models that would classify one of the letters in those pairs.

However, it didn’t seem to improve the user experience and we’ve decided to implement custom thresholds in the backend for those letters since the purpose of our project is to teach a user how to do the fingerspelling. The human mind is much more advanced than our model. If a user places his thumb finger just a little bit differently from what our model could understand, another person would be able to identify the gesture from the context correctly.

### Frontend/Backend
One of the front-end challenges was figuring out which react hooks to use. Another challenge was for the register and login pages when we tried to use an API call to save user info or create a new user at the backend. We had to use the useState() function to make that possible. We also had to give user states for each page to know which user it is.


## Future Work
Most of the future work would involve mostly the Frontend / Backend side of the application.

### ML Side
Future ideas for our application involving the ML side of the our project would be to expand the sign gester list to involve digit numbers 0-9. This would invlove expanding the model to classify the additional 10 different numbers.
### Frontend / Backend
A minor improvement on the current game levels is to include a timed section in which users would need to sign gesture a word within a time limit to test user's spelling speeds. To develop this into a consumer-grade product, we would add Google AdSense to start monetizing the website. We would have a system in place where users would subscribe to get rid of ads. Other features would include the addition of a mobile app and having users share their progress with others through social media.
